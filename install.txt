How to install:
==================
The upload folder contains all files for this module.
You will notice that the folders are in the same structure as your Opencart installation.

1. Navigate to your opencart root folder using an FTP program
2. Upload the "catalog", "system" and "admin" folder to your opencart installation folder
3. Go to your admin area in Extensions, select Modules from dropdown list and enable your REST Admin API extension
   You have to fill the Order id field (you can find it in the order email)
   You have to fill the API security key field (eg. 12345 or anything else)
   You have to use this key in your REST requests header.

   Extra header parameter name is: X-Oc-Restadmin-Id

4. Configure
    Go to your admin page and go to System -> Users -> User groups.
    Edit the user group you want to give access and modify permissions for the API.
    Give Access and Modify Permissions to the extension/module/rest_admin_api and Save the changes.

5. OPTIONAL: Update your .htaccess file, if you got any error on the API settings page after you installed it
   Paste the rewrite rules from the htaccess_rewrite_rules.txt file into your opencart root folder .htaccess file after "RewriteBase /"
